#### By **Vincent Kipngeno**
## Description
This is an application where users can register for their unique account or login using their phone number. On having a verified account they can then interact with others registered in the app through direct messaging and chatting. To have direct messages with a friend, first click on find friends option in the menu options and select a friend then send a message request or accept message requests from friends in the requests section. On approval of the message request, your friend will be added to your contacts and his contact will be available in the chat section for direct messaging. You can also remove contacts. Also the app has a section for searching Flickr photos. There is also a section for Social Streaming i.e posting news feeds and interesting posts for others to comment on and like, currently this section has no functionality it is being worked on. Also the groups part in the group section is still under development but to create a group you click on create group option in the menu options.
